# Twitter_data_Analysis
Summarization and extraction of Twitter data and visualization over World map

Twitter uses hashtags to represent topics, and anyone is authorized to make their own
hashtags once they signup. People voluntarily participate in various discussions and
tweet about it every second. Industries such as Marketing, Retail, e-Commerce,
Healthcare etc, use Twitter regularly to find out about general sentiments about specific
topics, and offer or customize various services, products they offer to their clients.
In order to do any analysis on trends, popularity, sentiments, etc. these tweets need to
be extracted and stored. Extracting all the tweets is not an option due to sheer volume of
data (tweets) produced every second, Hence a computer bot is required to fetch trending
hashtags and tweets and save them for further analysis.
In this project, ​ we intend to capture “geo - tagged” tweets with top 5 trending
hashtags and ​ try to ​ capture the generic sentiment of the world's population
towards these top trending topics.
